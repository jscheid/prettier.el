(defcustom prettier-diff-timeout-seconds 1.0
  "How many seconds the diff exploration phase may take in total.

This is the budget available for all diff operations during a
formatting run.  It is shared between diffing in the Node process
and any `replace-buffer-contents' invocations resulting from the
edits.

You can set this to zero to disable timeouts altogether, in which
case all diff operations will always run to completion.

This is essentially an upper bound on the duration of the diff
operation, which is the biggest part of the overhead added by
this package on top of formatting itself.  If the diff operation
is stopped early, the buffer will still be formatted correctly
but point (and region, overlays, etc.) might not be adjusted
correctly.

This setting shouldn't matter much for small files, or for large
files with only few individual edits resulting from Prettier
formatting, but it does matter for large files with many
edits (such as large foreign files never before formatted with
Prettier, or formatted with different settings) as these tend to
cause quite a lot of work for the diffing operation.

You may want to increase this setting (or disable it by setting
it to zero) if you care about point, region, etc.  being moved to
the correct location in all cases, and don't mind waiting a bit
longer for larger files.  On the other hand, if you're impatient
or if you don't care that point might be off in some cases, you
may want to decrease it."

SERVER-ID should be the symbol `local' for launching a local

NODE-COMMAND.

The process is launched by running `node' with a minified version
of `bootstrap.js` as a script provided on the command line; this
then loads a minified version of `prettier-el.js' from stdin.

This setup is used for the following reasons:

- The script can't be loaded from the local file system because
  the process might be launched remotely.

- The whole script can't be put on the command line because doing
  so doesn't work reliably via `tramp'.

Additional considerations were:

- The payload sent via stdin is base64-encoded with line breaks
  to ensure it can be sent via `tramp'.

- The payload is minified and gzip-compressed to help with
  startup time via `tramp' on slow, non-compressed connections."
