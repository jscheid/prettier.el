The ‘prettier’ Emacs package reformats your code by running Prettier
(https://github.com/prettier/prettier) with minimal overhead, by request
or transparently on file save.

Overhead on top of Prettier registers in the range of single-digit
milliseconds for reasonably sized files on a decent system.

Prettier is run in a long-running process so that Node startup overhead
is only paid once, and so that V8 JIT compilation has a better
opportunity to work its magic.

Additional features include first-class support for reformatting remote
files via ‘tramp-mode’ and integration with many major modes.

This is not the official Prettier integration for Emacs.  The official
package can be found at <https://github.com/prettier/prettier-emacs>.

1 Installation
**************

Install from MELPA (https://melpa.org/#/prettier), for example with ‘M-x
package-install RET prettier RET’.

A ‘node’ executable needs to be on ‘exec-path’.  It is recommended to
provide a recent version of Node since older versions tend to be
significantly slower.  ‘prettier’ also uses the Emacs ‘nvm’ package so
that if you have nvm (https://github.com/creationix/nvm), all you need
to do is run ‘nvm install node’ to ensure the latest version is
available.

The Prettier package needs to be installed inside your npm package, or
globally with either ‘npm’ or ‘yarn’.  Version 1.6 is the minimum
requirement but it’s recommended to use the latest version in order to
get access to all parsers, features and bugfixes.

You can use ‘M-x prettier-info’ to see which versions are being used for
a given buffer and to aid with diagnosis when Node or Prettier can’t be
found.

The above instructions are for reformatting local files; see below for
how to configure remote systems.

* Troubleshooting::


File: prettier.info,  Node: Troubleshooting,  Up: Installation

1.1 Troubleshooting
===================

If you see the error ‘Cannot find prettier anywhere’ even though
Prettier is installed globally, you might be using ‘node’ installed via
‘snap’ on Ubuntu.  When installed using this method, ‘node’ is unable to
find globally installed packages.  This can be worked around by setting
‘NODE_PATH’ explicitly, for example:

(setenv "NODE_PATH" "/usr/local/lib/node_modules")


File: prettier.info,  Node: Configuration,  Next: Usage,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

2 Configuration
***************

Use ‘M-x global-prettier-mode’ to turn on the minor mode in all major
modes supported by your version of Prettier and by any plugins installed
(see *note prettier-enabled-parsers: #prettier-enabled-parsers. below.)
When enabled, the minor mode will reformat on file save and also sync
settings from Prettier to Emacs, such as indentation level.

To enable ‘prettier-mode’ globally at startup:

(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-prettier-mode)

* Menu:

* Enabling per-file / per-directory::


File: prettier.info,  Node: Enabling per-file / per-directory,  Up: Configuration

2.1 Enabling per-file / per-directory
=====================================

emacs has a great feature called Per-Directory Local Variables
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html#Directory-Variables),
which can be utilised to automatically enable ‘prettier-mode’ for
specific files or directories.  For example, if you put the following in
a ‘.dir-locals.el’ file at the top of a git repository:

((js-mode . ((eval . (prettier-mode t)))))

then it should automatically enable ‘prettier-mode’ for any files using
‘js-mode’.  (N.B. If the files are already open, you will have to close
and re-open them to see this take effect.)  You could also match by file
path instead of by mode, as described in the above docs.

There is an alternative mechanism which can be handy if you want to
avoid adding ‘.dir-locals.el’ to a directory; add these to your emacs
config:

(dir-locals-set-class-variables 'prettier-js
                                '((js-mode . ((eval . (prettier-mode t))))))
(dir-locals-set-directory-class "/path/to/my/pretty/project/" 'prettier-js)


File: prettier.info,  Node: Usage,  Next: Customization,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: Top

3 Usage
*******

When enabled as a minor mode with ‘prettier-mode’, your source code is
formatted on save.

You can also ‘M-x prettier-prettify’ to prettify the whole buffer at any
time in any buffer (doing so doesn’t require the minor mode to be
enabled), and ‘M-x prettier-prettify-region’ to prettify region (but
note that region should align with a complete block of code).

If you give a prefix argument to either of these two commands you will
be able to set/override the Prettier parser to use for formatting.

File: prettier.info,  Node: Changing Prettier Configuration,  Next: On Remote Servers,  Up: Usage

3.1 Changing Prettier Configuration
===================================

You should run ‘M-x prettier-restart’ whenever any relevant
configuration changes, such as when you install a new version of Node,
Prettier, or any plugins; when you install or uninstall Prettier as a
local npm package in a directory from which you already have files open
in Emacs; or when you change Prettier settings that might affect any
open files.  Doing so will clear all caches and ensure that your changes
are picked up.


File: prettier.info,  Node: On Remote Servers,  Prev: Changing Prettier Configuration,  Up: Usage

3.2 On Remote Servers
=====================

When you edit files on a remote host, Prettier will be run remotely on
that host.  It follows that the remote host needs to have Node and
Prettier installed as described above.  ‘nvm’ can’t be used on remote
hosts; you will have to ensure ‘tramp-remote-path’ is set correctly.

Remote formatting might be improved in the future in the following ways:

   • Using remote Prettier only to determine options for the remote
     file, but using local Prettier to do the actual formatting.  This
     would help with large source files and slow connections.

   • Obviating the need for remote Prettier by walking the remote
     filesystem and finding configuration files.  This is unlikely to
     happen because it would mean having to keep this package’s code in
     sync with Prettier configuration discovery logic.

File: prettier.info,  Node: prettier-mode-sync-config-flag,  Next: prettier-editorconfig-flag,  Up: Customization

4.1 ‘prettier-mode-sync-config-flag’
====================================

Set this to ‘nil’ if you don’t want ‘prettier-mode’ to change your
buffer-local settings to match Prettier options.


File: prettier.info,  Node: prettier-editorconfig-flag,  Next: prettier-enabled-parsers,  Prev: prettier-mode-sync-config-flag,  Up: Customization

4.2 ‘prettier-editorconfig-flag’
================================

Set this to ‘nil’ if you don’t want Prettier to use ‘.editorconfig’
files to load options.


File: prettier.info,  Node: prettier-enabled-parsers,  Next: prettier-infer-parser-flag,  Prev: prettier-editorconfig-flag,  Up: Customization

4.3 ‘prettier-enabled-parsers’
==============================

Customize this to disable any parsers you don’t want to use.


File: prettier.info,  Node: prettier-infer-parser-flag,  Next: prettier-prettify-on-save-flag,  Prev: prettier-enabled-parsers,  Up: Customization

4.4 ‘prettier-infer-parser-flag’
================================

Set this to ‘nil’ if you don’t want Prettier to fall back to inferring
the parser to use based on the file name and contents.


File: prettier.info,  Node: prettier-prettify-on-save-flag,  Next: prettier-inline-errors-flag,  Prev: prettier-infer-parser-flag,  Up: Customization

4.5 ‘prettier-prettify-on-save-flag’
====================================

Set this to ‘nil’ if you don’t want Prettier to prettify (format) the
buffer when saving.  You can still format the buffer explicitly with
‘prettier-prettify’, which you might want to bind to a key.


File: prettier.info,  Node: prettier-inline-errors-flag,  Next: prettier-pre-warm,  Prev: prettier-prettify-on-save-flag,  Up: Customization

4.6 ‘prettier-inline-errors-flag’
=================================

Set this to ‘t’ if you want syntax errors to be shown inline instead of
sending them to the default error buffer.  This feature is experimental
and won’t yet work well when the error is outside the window.


File: prettier.info,  Node: prettier-pre-warm,  Next: prettier-mode-ignore-buffer-function,  Prev: prettier-inline-errors-flag,  Up: Customization

4.7 ‘prettier-pre-warm’
=======================

Choose how to pre-warm Prettier caches.

Essentially this selects when you wait for Prettier startup overhead:
with ‘none’, you tend to wait for it on first save.  With ‘full’, you
wait when ‘prettier-mode’ is first activated.

‘some’ is a compromise, with it you wait some on first activation and
some on first save.


File: prettier.info,  Node: prettier-mode-ignore-buffer-function,  Next: prettier-mode-lighter,  Prev: prettier-pre-warm,  Up: Customization

4.8 ‘prettier-mode-ignore-buffer-function’
==========================================

This function is called in every buffer that ‘prettier-mode’ supports.
If it returns non-nil, the buffer is ignored and ‘prettier-mode’ won’t
be activated for it.  The default is to ignore buffers for files nested
beneath a ‘node_modules’ directory.  You can set this to ‘nil’ and no
buffers will be ignored.


File: prettier.info,  Node: prettier-mode-lighter,  Next: prettier-diff-timeout-seconds,  Prev: prettier-mode-ignore-buffer-function,  Up: Customization

4.9 ‘prettier-mode-lighter’
===========================

This Sexpr is evaluated as part of the modeline.  The default value
shows the string ‘Prettier’ as well as the Prettier parser and Prettier
version used for the buffer.


File: prettier.info,  Node: prettier-diff-timeout-seconds,  Next: prettier-diff-edit-cost,  Prev: prettier-mode-lighter,  Up: Customization

4.10 ‘prettier-diff-timeout-seconds’
====================================

Choose how long the diff operation is allowed to run, which matters for
large files with many edits resulting from Prettier reformatting.  The
diff is required only for moving point to the correct new location (and
adjust region, overlays etc.), so essentially this lets you decide how
long you are willing to wait for this.  A setting of 0 disables the
timeout and lets the diff always run to completion.  This used to be
fixed at 1 second pre-1.4.0.

See
https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/API#diff_maintext1-text2–diffs
(diff-match-patch%20documentation).


File: prettier.info,  Node: prettier-diff-edit-cost,  Prev: prettier-diff-timeout-seconds,  Up: Customization

4.11 ‘prettier-diff-edit-cost’
==============================

Determines how aggressively individual edits resulting from Prettier
reformatting get coalesced into larger edits.  The default setting
should work reasonably well.  This can be set to 0 to disabled grouping
of edits altogether, which was the behaviour pre-1.4.0.

See
https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/API#diff_cleanupefficiencydiffs–null
(diff-match-patch%20documentation).


File: prettier.info,  Node: Differences from prettier-emacs,  Next: Credits,  Prev: Customization,  Up: Top

5 Differences from ‘prettier-emacs’
***********************************

   • ‘prettier-emacs’ launches Prettier in an external process, paying
     the Node startup overhead on each invocation unless mitigated by
     tools such as ‘prettier_d’.  This package uses a long-running child
     process.

   • ‘prettier-emacs’ lets Prettier guess the parser to use based on the
     filename.  This package instead derives the parser from the major
     mode when possible and falls back to a guess based on the filename
     only when the major mode isn’t supported.

   • ‘prettier-emacs’ doesn’t touch your buffer configuration, such as
     indentation offsets.  ‘prettier-mode’, by default, tries to set the
     buffer configuration to match Prettier configuration as closely as
     possible.

   • This package keeps point at the same location relative to your
     code.

   • This package has first-class support for editing remote files via
     ‘tramp-mode’ (with some room for improvement for large source files
     and slow connections), and for using a local Prettier installation
     (in your project’s ‘node_modules’ rather than installed globally.)

   • ‘prettier-emacs’ allows overriding various Prettier options by
     setting ‘prettier-js-args’ or ‘prettier-js-width-mode’.  In
     contrast, this package believes that your Prettier configuration
     files should serve as the single source of truth.
